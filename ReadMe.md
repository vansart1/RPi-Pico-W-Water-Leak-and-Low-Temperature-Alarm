Water Leak and Low Temperature Alarm and SMS Notifier

This code is made to run on a Raspberry-Pi Pico W.

If a water leak is detected (by using an analog input), or if the temperature drops too low (by using the onboard temp sensor), an alarm sounds by activating a digital pin and the user is notified by SMS using the Twilio API

Code was based on the following project: https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/smart-plant-example-for-pico-w
